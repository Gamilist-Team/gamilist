## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

Successfully implemented GitHub OAuth authentication and the game list tracking system. The integration with IGDB API for fetching game data worked smoothly, and users can now add games to their lists with different statuses (Playing, Completed, Plan to Play).

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

Handling foreign key constraints when users add games from the IGDB API to their lists.

### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?

Yes, completed all planned tasks including user authentication, game list management, and the rating system. The priority was getting the core CRUD operations working first, then adding the review and achievement features.

### Which features and user stories would you consider "at risk"? How will you change your plan if those items remain "at risk"?

The achievement system was initially at risk due to automatic triggering complexity.

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

Would benefit from guidance on deployment best practices, especially for managing environment variables and database migrations on Render. Also need help with optimizing API calls to IGDB to avoid rate limiting.
