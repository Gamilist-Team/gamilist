Coordinating database schema changes without losing existing data. Had to create a migration script to preserve teammate's work while implementing new features.

Yes, completed all planned features. All 5 GitHub issues have been implemented with full CRUD operations, React Router navigation, and database relationships.

### Which features and user stories would you consider "at risk"? How will you change your plan if those items remain "at risk"?

All features are now implemented and working. Deployment to Render is the final step, which should be straightforward with existing configuration.
